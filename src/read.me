For this assignment I decided to tried to implement 3 API's in my web app.
The first one was an inspirational quote API that generated quotes from chat GPT.
I was able to use the chatGPT key that was provided in Class 2 generate quotes inside of a pre-existing dev on my page if I were to generate those quotes using Postman.

I would require an API key, then I would need to insert appropriate custom headers.
 I would have to make a POST request with a Json formatted body that had "model‚Äù, "messages", "role": for the system and the user and "content" properties. 
 I ended up using a get request for my inspirational quote API that also utilized an open API endpoint in order to make that same request in Postman I would have had to known the proper parameters  and headers to obtain randomly generated quotes. 

I also utilized a voice to text API without an endpoint. I will have to reseach more methods.
